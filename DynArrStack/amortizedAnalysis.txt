Q1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array? As N
(ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?

A1a.
- Since the array's initial size is 8, the cost of the first 8 elements is 8
- Adding the 9th element costs (8+1) = 9 and the array is resized to 16
- Elements 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 each cost 1 totaling to 7
- Adding the 17th element costs (16+1) = 17 and the array is resized to 32
- Elements 18, 19...31, 32 each cost 1 totaling to 15
- Adding the 33rd element costs (32+1) = 33 and the array is resized to 64
- Elements, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 38, 40 each cost 1 totaling to 7
- Total cost is (8+9+7+17+15+33+7) = 96 units for adding 40 elements in this way

A1b.
- N operation of N pushes will cost 1+2+4+8+16+32+...+2^k when 2^k < N
- Summing the series gives 2^(k-1) - 2
- However, 2^k <= n <= 2^(k-1)
- Total cost of sequence of n insertions: O(n)
- Amortized (average) cost (total cost/n): O(1)

Q2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
at capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant 2 spaces each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic
array? As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a
push?

A2a.
- Since the array's initial size is 8, the cost of the first 8 elements is 8
- Adding the 9th element costs (8+1) = 9 and the array is resized to 10
- Element 10 costs 1
- Adding the 11th element cost (10+1) = 11 and the array is resized to 12
- Element 12 costs 1
- Adding the 13th element cost (12+1) = 13 and the array is resized to 14
- Element 14 costs 1
- Adding the 15th element cost (14+1) = 15 and the array is resized to 16
- Element 16 costs 1
- Adding the 17th element cost (16+1) = 17 and the array is resized to 18
- Element 18 costs 1
- Adding the 19th element cost (18+1) = 19 and the array is resized to 20
...
- Element 38 costs 1
- Adding the 11th element cost (38+1) = 39 and the array is resized to 40
- Element 40 costs 1
- Total cost is (8+9+1+11+1+13+1+15+1+17+1+19+...+1+39+1) = 408 units for adding 40 elements in this way

A2b.
- N operations of N pushes will cost 1+2+3+4+5+6+...+N+1
- Summing the series gives N(N-1)/2
- Total cost of sequence of n insertions: O(n^2)
- Amortized (average) cost (total cost/n): O(n)
